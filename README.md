###### SAOSLab Instructions

To make all of some of the scripts work you may have to change some of the variables because in different PC program locations are different.

Scripts could be provided with installer so that it appropriately prepares the environment and sets required path. That also limits the robustness of scripts. You have the freedom to modify current scripts according to your need.

Some components are derived from other projects of SAOSLab
* Delay.exe comes from [Delay Timer Project](https://github.com/sacsdu/Delay-Timer)
